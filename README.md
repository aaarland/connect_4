## Purpose of this game
I created this game to show my younger brother the possibilites of learning to program.
He enjoys playing video games so I wanted to show him that it doesn't take too long to create your own.
I made the draft of this in a day. It is still missing some features that I would like to implement, 
but is a good starting point to understand the world of programming.

## Future implementations

- Start screen where player can add names to each color
- Victory screen to show the winning player and end the game
- Color picker so the players can choose their favorite game
- Ai player, using min-max algorithm or random placement for easier game.
